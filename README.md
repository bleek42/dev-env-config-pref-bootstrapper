#### Instructions
- Install Windows Terminal, Neofetch & Oh My Posh with a Package Manager, like Scoop, Winget, or Chocolatey.
- copy your desired config.omp.json file with your Oh My Posh prompt style into your users home folder
- either copy the contents of 'bash/' into your users home folder & rename them with a '.' infront of their names in order to hide them, or copy & paste them to the bottom of your corresponding files in Program Files/Git/bin (or /bin, where ever .profile, .bashrc, etc. are located)
- Add Git Bash For Windows to Windows Terminal profile json file in by right-clicking the edge of the terminal, select settings, select "Open JSON"
